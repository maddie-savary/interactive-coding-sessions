## ANATOMY OF AN IF STATEMENT
# An if statement begins with a word if:
# After the if statement, we have: a logical statement, or logical test,
# or logical expression is any expressionn that is going to evaluate to True or False
# after that, a colon:
# On the next line follows an INDENTED CODE BLOCK:
# The intended code block is what the machine will run IF the logical statement 
# evaluates to True. Otherwise, it will NOT run.

# After this code block, you can have between zero and many ELIF statements. 
# Structure: elif LOGICAL_STATEMENT:
# each followed by their own code block 
# When will these code blocks run?
# 1. When the logical statement is True AND 
# 2. None of the PREVIOUS ones are true 
# Conditional logic blocks run sequentially, one statement at a time.
# And they stop at the first True statement that they encounter.
# The FINAL statement can be (but does not have to be) and ELSE statement:
# else: # Note that there is no condition!
# When is the else block going to run? 
# ONLY when ALL the statements have evaluated to False 

# VERY COMMON GOTCHA WITH CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:

def status_checker(age):
    if age >= 13:
        print("You are a teenager")
    elif age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult")
    elif age >= 4:
        print("You are a kid")
    else:
        print("You are a baby")

status_checker(1)
status_checker(5)
status_checker(17)
status_checker(39)

def correct_status_checker(age):
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are an adult")
    elif age >= 13:
        print("You are a teenager")
    elif age >= 4:
        print("You are a kid")
    else:
        print("You are a baby")

# ALWAYS CHECK THE MOST RESTRICTIVE CONDITION FIRST:

def can_legally_drink(country, age):
    if (country == "USA"):
        if (age >= 21):
            return True
        else: 
            return False
    elif (country == "Canada"):
        if (age >= 19):
            return True
        else:
            return False 
    elif (country == 'Germany'):
        if (age >= 16):
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return "Don't know"

# Trick 1: You can write a simple if statement in one line. 
# That's allowed, it's called the "TERNARY OPERATOR":
age = 20

status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"

# VALUE_IF_TRUE if LOGICAL STATEMENT else VALUE_IF_FALSE
if age >= 18:
    status = "Adult"
else: 
    status = "Minor"

# Trick # 2
# You can sometimes save yourself a lot of effort by using a dictionary 
# rather than an if statement.

# Let's say you want to map countries to their currency:

def get_country_currency(country):
    if country == "USA":
        return "US Dollars"
    elif country == "Canada":
        return "Canadian Dollars"
    elif country == "France":
        return "Euros"
    elif country == "Japan":
        return "Yen"
    else: 
        return "Country not found"
# Good, but not great. 
# Let's take a step back. What are we doing here?
# We are alwayus checking the value of one variable,
# (country) and depending on the value, returning another value. 

# It works a lot like a dictionary!
country_currency = {
    "USA": "US Dollars",
    "Canada": "Canadian Dollars",
    "France": "Euros",
    "Japan": "Yen"
}
# How do we get the currency?
country_currency["France"]

# Wait a minute... This is NOT the same thing. 
get_country_currency("Iran") # Country not found!
country_currency["Iran"] # KeyError

# However...
country_currency.get("Iran", "Country not found")
